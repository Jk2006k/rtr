# RTR — React to React Native Converter

###  Transform your React web apps into React Native mobile-ready projects in seconds!

RTR (React To React Native) is a powerful web-based tool that automatically converts existing **React.js** web applications into **React Native** code.
It helps developers quickly migrate their web UI into mobile environments, saving countless hours of manual code rewriting.

##  How It Works

1. **Upload your React project (.zip)**

   * The server extracts your uploaded project safely.

2. **Conversion Process**

   * The backend scans each React component file and replaces:

     * HTML tags (`div`, `h1`, `button`, etc.) with React Native components (`View`, `Text`, `TouchableOpacity`, etc.)
     * CSS class-based styles into React Native StyleSheet syntax.
     * Browser imports with React Native compatible imports.

3. **Zipping and Downloading**

   * After conversion, a `.zip` file is generated containing your **React Native** version.
   * You can download it directly from the interface.

4. **Auto Cleanup**

   * The backend deletes old converted files daily to save server storage.
